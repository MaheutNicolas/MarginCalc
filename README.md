# MarginCalc
My second program, an application to compute recipe cost.

## Structure
I try this time to separate file and function and use object oriented programming.
Each page has a class link to it, a object is created by recipe (RecipeClass)
and every page can directly use it.

## Leson Learned
My trie in create better code is an echec in this step.
the code is way to messy.
Create better architecture was the new goal.
